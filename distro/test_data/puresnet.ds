# Dataset for rescoring PUResNetV2.0 predictions.


# Note: 'prank rescore' expects 2 columns: prediction, protein
# Providing protein (with or without ligands) that was used to calculate the prediction is required.
# Proteins have to be liganated only if you want to calculate metrics by running 'prank eval-rescore'.

# Note: this dataset CANNOT be used for eval-rescore
# because protein column points to proteins without known ligands.

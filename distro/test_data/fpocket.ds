# Dataset for rescoring Fpocket 1 predictions / evaluating rescoring.
# (predictions generated with Fpocket 1.0)
#
# Note: this dataset (unlike fpocket3.ds) can be used for eval-rescore
# because protein column points to proteins with known ligands.

PARAM.PREDICTION_METHOD=fpocket

# specifies that ligands are separated by TER record (relevant only for lagacy CHEN11 and derived datasets)
PARAM.LIGANDS_SEPARATED_BY_TER=true

# Dataset for rescoring ConCavity predictions / evaluating rescoring.

# Note: 'prank rescore' expects 2 columns: prediction, protein
# Providing protein (with or without ligands) that was used to calculate the prediction is required.
# Proteins have to be liganated only if you want to calculate metrics by running 'prank eval-rescore'.


PARAM.PREDICTION_METHOD=concavity


# specifies that ligands are separated by TER record (relevant only for legacy CHEN11 and derived datasets)
# remove for other datasets
PARAM.LIGANDS_SEPARATED_BY_TER=true
